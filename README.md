Welcome to the mini-projects respository. Here, I upload my simple, yet partially useful programs for those who find it so.
Most of the projects listed here will either be programmed using C, C++, Javascript, etc. Of course, there would come a time when I would upload a project written in a different programming language. Yet for now, let this serve as an archieve for the projects I've created throughout my interest in learning the fundamentals of computer science and programming.
